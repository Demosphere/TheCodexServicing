### Week 1

1/27/2016 

Completed:
 * Chose a project goal. Going to go with a White Wolf Tabletop Game Interface
 * Reviewed SkinnySki.com 
 * Created this repository 
 * Wrote the problem statement. Playing a Table Top game is rather manual so I would like to automate some of the processes that are involved in playing the game.
 * Started documenting the project plan. project being a White Wolf Tabletop Game interface.
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project
   * Standard technologies that the class uses.
   * A soon to be known web chat web service.
   * A soon to be know random number API.
* Need to get back in the habit of doing all of my HW on Sunday mornings instead of trying to get it done before class starts.

I know what I want to do. Something that will help some friends and I play a tabletop rpg that we play and have played together for years. I need to determine a scope and figure out how much of the games mechanics that I would like to automate.

Again, I need to get back into the habit of doing my HW on Sunday mornings so things actually get all of the way done before class.

### Week 2

2/3/2016

- Did the activities and readings. 
- Thought more about what I was gonna do for my project. 
  - Theorized how I would want things organized for the web site interface with the user.
  - Theorized more on the database structure that I would need in order to facilitate the game system that I am going to be recreating with the web site.
  - Tried to narrow the scope of the individual project in order to make sure that I actually get stufff done for the project and don't get overwhelmed.
  - didn't get anything done on sunday like I wanted to do cause I am lazy and can't get back into habits after I breadk them.
