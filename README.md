This repository will serve as the main repository for my individual enterprise Java project.

Problem Statement

For the past 8 years I have played a table top game via lookings through pyhsical books and electronic pdfs in order to find various rules and such for playing the game. While this is adequate, there is no "good" web medium that allows you to reference all of this information together and therefore it can become encumbersone while playing the game to have various books, notes and pdfs open. "The Codex: Role Playing Game Reference Document" (TheCodexrpgrd) website will aim to correct this by providing a complete reference document that will have organized information based on the game that is being played. 

The game of focus from the initial implementatation will be a game that I am playing at the moment, Vampire: The Masqurade which is a White Wolf / Onyx Path table top roles playing game system. The content of the website will focus primarily on the systems of the game and will leave out much of the fluff information to attempt to avoid causing lawsuits. 

It is my hope that this reference document website can be used by me and other people to streamline there table top role playing game experience.

Scope

WW Vampire Character sheet:
- [Vampire Character Sheet](http://sorwen.com/vampire/BairnAmbroseKane.jpg)
  - This character sheet is what I am aiming to duplicate with a fully interactive website that will allow you to roll dice based on the dots that are next to an ability and it will fully describe the powers and abilities of the character.

- Technolgies:
  - Database (MySQL and Hibernate)
    - Store users and roles
    - Stores Game information
      - All reference materials will be stored on various database tables.
    - See database pyhsical structure diagram below
  - Web Services or APIs:
    - ? Email web service for an RSS feed for when the website receives updates and new materials.
  - Bootstrap will be utilized for the basic structure and css files.
  - Logging:
    - Configurable logging using Log4J. 
    - In production, only errors will normally be logged, but logging at a debug level can be turned on to facilitate trouble-shooting.
  - Hosting:
    - Site and database hosted on OpenShift
  - Unit Testing
    - JUnit tests to achieve at least 80% code coverage

- Simple database structure provided below of parent child relationships.
  - USER
  - USERROLES

  - LEVEL1              
    - Contains game information 
    - ID, Name, Description

Independent Research Topic:
- This will be done on large text datastorage, specifically on Blob and text datatypes in relation to storage on a database.
- This will be implemented into my project as I have many columns which will require a large length.
